# Clothing-website-Saima-boutique-
Creating a website for a customer using html javascript and mysql (haven't decided to use a server side language/framework as it the use of it is not justified yet, but if needed to options such as flask or django seem suitable)

# Security
As I was talking to the client this topic came up and I'm aware that we are directly interacting with the database on the client side (without a server) the justification for this is as the customer intends to have no login feature for customers therefore so reducing the security risk, the intention is that paypal will handle the payments if needs be. The intention is to have no login feature for customers (Although I tried to advise the customer otherwise)

# Need for server side code
Client-Side (Frontend): Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that run in the user's browser.
Server-Side (Backend): Handles interactions with the database and serves data to the client-side. This is typically implemented using Node.js
in order to get data from the database we need the server side interacting with the database to do this we will use NODE
